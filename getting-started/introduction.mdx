## What is Voxmind?

Voxmind is a voice biometrics API that lets you add **real-time voice authentication** and **AI voice clone detection** to any application in hours. Instead of passwords, PINs, or knowledge-based questions, your users simply speak — and Voxmind tells you in under 2 seconds whether the voice is genuine, enrolled, and human.

What makes Voxmind different from traditional voice biometrics is that it was built from the ground up for the era of AI-generated audio. Legacy voice systems were designed when the threat was simple replay attacks. Today, anyone can clone a voice from a 3-second sample using freely available tools. Voxmind's phoneme-level analysis measures anatomical constants of the vocal tract — characteristics that AI voice clones cannot replicate — achieving 99.8% deepfake detection accuracy.

## How Voxmind works in 30 seconds

The API follows a simple three-step model that maps naturally to any authentication flow.

First, you **enroll** a user — submit a short voice recording (3–5 seconds is enough) and Voxmind creates a voiceprint tied to your user's ID in your system. Second, when that user needs to authenticate, you **verify** — submit a new recording and Voxmind returns a match score and a pass/fail decision in under 2 seconds. At the same time, a parallel **deepfake detection** check runs automatically, flagging synthetic or replayed audio before it can ever pass verification.

<Note>
Voxmind is **text-independent and language-agnostic**. Users can say anything in any of our 15+ supported languages during enrollment and verification — there's no required passphrase.

## Who is this for?

If you're building any of the following, Voxmind was designed for you:

- **Contact centre platforms** reducing authentication handle time and stopping account takeover fraud
- **Fintech and banking apps** adding step-up voice verification for high-risk transactions
- **Voice AI agents** that need continuous identity assurance during a conversation
- **Identity verification pipelines** adding a biometric layer to existing KYC flows
- **Employee access systems** using voice as a secure, hardware-free key
