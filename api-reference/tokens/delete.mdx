title: "Delete Token"
api: "DELETE /organisations/{orgId}/api-tokens/{tokenId}"
description: "Permanently delete an API token record. The token is immediately invalidated and cannot be recovered."
authMethod: "bearer"
---

## Overview

Permanently removes a token from your organisation. Any API request using this token after deletion will return `401 Unauthorized`. Unlike disabling a token (PATCH), deletion is irreversible — use it for tokens that are confirmed decommissioned and no longer needed for audit trail purposes.

<Warning>
Deleting a token that is still in use by a production service will immediately break those API calls. Confirm the token is no longer in use before deleting. When in doubt, disable first (PATCH `enabled: false`) and monitor for 401 errors before proceeding to delete.
</Warning>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="orgId" type="string" required>
  Your organisation's unique identifier.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tokenId" type="string" required>
  The numeric ID of the token to permanently delete.
</ParamField>
