title: Language Support
description: All languages supported by VoxMind's voice biometrics engine.
---

VoxMind's phoneme extraction model (XLSR-300M) was trained across 128 languages, making the core voice biometrics engine genuinely language-agnostic. This means a user can enroll in one language and authenticate in another — the voiceprint captures anatomical constants that don't change with language.

The `language` parameter on enrollment and verification calls helps the phoneme segmentation model apply the correct acoustic boundaries for the submitted audio. It's optional (defaulting to `en-UK`) but specifying the correct language improves accuracy, particularly for languages with phoneme inventories that differ significantly from English.

## Supported language codes

The `language` field uses `[ISO 639-1]-[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]` format.

| Language | Code |
|---|---|
| English (UK) | `en-UK` |
| English (US) | `en-US` |
| French | `fr-FR` |
| German | `de-DE` |
| Spanish (Spain) | `es-ES` |
| Spanish (Latin America) | `es-MX` |
| Italian | `it-IT` |
| Portuguese (Brazil) | `pt-BR` |
| Portuguese (Portugal) | `pt-PT` |
| Dutch | `nl-NL` |
| Polish | `pl-PL` |
| Russian | `ru-RU` |
| Arabic (Modern Standard) | `ar-SA` |
| Hindi | `hi-IN` |
| Mandarin Chinese | `zh-CN` |
| Japanese | `ja-JP` |
| Korean | `ko-KR` |

Additional language support is being expanded continuously. If your use case requires a language not listed, contact [support@voxmind.ai](mailto:support@voxmind.ai) — we can often add support for specific languages on request.
