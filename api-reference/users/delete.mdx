title: "Delete User"
api: "DELETE /organisations/{orgId}/users/{userId}"
description: "Permanently delete a user and their associated voiceprint data. Irreversible. Use for GDPR right-to-erasure requests."
authMethod: "bearer"
---

## Overview

Permanently removes a user record and all associated voiceprint data from Voxmind's systems. This action cannot be undone. After deletion, the `external_id` is free to be re-enrolled as a new user if needed.

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent and includes the voiceprint. If you only want to prevent a user from authenticating temporarily, use the Update User endpoint to set `is_active: false` instead. Reserve deletion for permanent removal scenarios.
</Warning>

The primary use case for deletion is fulfilling GDPR right-to-erasure requests — when a user requests that your platform delete all data associated with them, this endpoint ensures Voxmind's copy of their biometric data is also removed.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="orgId" type="string" required>
  Your organisation's unique identifier.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  Voxmind's internal numeric ID for the user to permanently delete.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.voxmind.ai/organisations/42/users/1001 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
# Typical GDPR erasure workflow:
# 1. Find the Voxmind user ID from your external_id
resp = requests.get(
    "https://api.voxmind.ai/organisations/42/users",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"},
    params={"filter": "external_id=user_98765"},
)
voxmind_id = resp.json()["results"][0]["id"]

# 2. Delete the record (voiceprint included)
resp = requests.delete(
    f"https://api.voxmind.ai/organisations/42/users/{voxmind_id}",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"},
)
# 200 = permanently deleted
```

</RequestExample>
