title: Filtering, Sorting & Pagination
description: How to query list endpoints effectively using VoxMind's filter, sort, and pagination system.
---

All VoxMind list endpoints (`GET /organisations/{id}/users`, `GET /organisations/{id}/api-tokens`, etc.) support a consistent query system for filtering results, sorting them, and paginating through large collections. Once you understand the pattern, it applies identically across every list endpoint.

## Filtering

Filtering is controlled via the `filter` query parameter. Multiple filter conditions are comma-separated, and the system evaluates them with an implicit AND — meaning all conditions must be true for a result to be returned.

The basic syntax for equality is `field=value`. For inequality, use `field!=value`. For more advanced comparisons, VoxMind supports a colon-delimited comparator syntax: `field=comparator:value`.

The supported comparators are `gt` (greater than), `gte` (greater than or equal to), `lt` (less than), `lte` (less than or equal to), `like` (case-sensitive pattern match), and `ilike` (case-insensitive pattern match). The `like` and `ilike` comparators support standard SQL-style wildcards: `%` matches any string of zero or more characters, and `_` matches any single character.

Here are some practical examples to illustrate the pattern:

```
# Get all tokens with a specific friendly name prefix
GET /organisations/{id}/api-tokens?filter=friendly_name=like:production%

# Get users created after a specific date
GET /organisations/{id}/users?filter=created_at=gte:2025-01-01T00:00:00Z

# Combine conditions: active users with a specific external ID pattern
GET /organisations/{id}/users?filter=is_active=true,external_id=like:user_%

# Exclude a specific value
GET /organisations/{id}/users?filter=external_id!=deleted_user_123
```

## Sorting

Sorting is controlled via the `sort` query parameter. It uses the same colon-delimiter pattern for direction: `sort=field:direction`. Use `asc` for ascending (A→Z, oldest→newest) and `desc` for descending. Multiple sort keys are comma-separated and applied in order of priority.

```
# Sort by creation date, newest first
GET /organisations/{id}/users?sort=created_at:desc

# Sort by name ascending, then by creation date descending as a tiebreaker
GET /organisations/{id}/users?sort=name:asc,created_at:desc
```

## Pagination

VoxMind uses page/per_page pagination rather than cursor-based pagination. The `per_page` parameter controls how many results are returned per page (maximum 300, default 100), and the `page` parameter specifies which page of results you want, starting at 1.

The response headers include `X-Total-Pages`, which tells you how many pages exist in total for your query. This lets you build a complete pagination loop without needing to guess when you've reached the end.

```bash
# Get the second page of results, 50 per page
GET /organisations/{id}/users?per_page=50&page=2

# Check the X-Total-Pages header in the response
# X-Total-Pages: 7 → there are 7 pages total at 50 items each
```

## Combining all three

The real power comes from combining filtering, sorting, and pagination together to build efficient queries. For example, to retrieve all enabled API tokens ordered by creation date, 20 at a time:

```bash
GET /organisations/{id}/api-tokens?filter=enabled=true&sort=created_at:desc&per_page=20&page=1
```

If `X-Total-Pages` returns 3, you'd make two additional requests with `page=2` and `page=3` to retrieve the complete set. A clean pattern for this in application code is to loop while `current_page <= total_pages`, incrementing `page` on each iteration.
