description: "Create a voiceprint for a user from a voice recording. Returns 202 immediately; result delivered via webhook."
authMethod: "bearer"
---

## Overview

Enrollment is the process of creating a voiceprint — a mathematical representation of a user's unique vocal characteristics — from a voice recording. Once enrolled, a user can be verified at any time by submitting a new recording and comparing it against their stored voiceprint.

Enrollment is **asynchronous**. You submit the request, receive a 202 Accepted immediately, and VoxMind delivers the result (including voiceprint quality score and status) to your configured callback URL when processing is complete. This typically takes 1–3 seconds.

<Note>
A user's `external_id` is your identifier — use whatever format you use in your own system (UUID, integer, email, etc.). VoxMind doesn't validate the format; it just stores and returns it. Consistency is what matters: the same `external_id` must be used in all future verification calls for this user.
</Note>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="orgId" type="string" required>
  Your organisation's unique identifier. Found in your dashboard or returned by `GET /organisations/{orgId}`.
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="voice_data" type="string (binary)" required>
  The user's voice recording, base64-encoded. Accepted formats: WAV, MP3. Minimum 3 seconds of speech; 5 seconds recommended for optimal accuracy. Minimum sample rate: 16kHz.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_uuid" type="string (UUID)" required>
  A unique identifier you generate for this request. VoxMind returns this value in the webhook callback so you can match the async result to the originating request. Use UUID v4.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="external_id" type="string" required>
  Your user's identifier in your system. This is the key used to associate verifications with this enrollment. Must be consistent across all calls for the same user.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="en-UK">
  The primary language of the audio, in `[ISO 639-1]-[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]` format (e.g., `en-UK`, `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`). VoxMind is language-agnostic — users can verify in any language after enrolling — but specifying the language improves phoneme boundary detection accuracy. See [Language Support](/guides/language-support) for all supported values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="device_fingerprint" type="string">
  Optional. A unique identifier for the device the user is using during enrollment. Used for device-level fraud analytics and to associate voiceprints with specific hardware.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="device_type" type="integer">
  Optional. An integer representing the category of device. `0` = unknown, `1` = mobile phone, `2` = desktop/laptop, `3` = IP phone/desk phone. Used for analytics and to contextualise match scores — audio characteristics vary across device types.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="callback_url" type="string">
  The webhook URL VoxMind will call with the enrollment result. This is your configured callback URL pulled from organisation settings.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A human-readable confirmation that the request was accepted and is being processed.
</ResponseField>
